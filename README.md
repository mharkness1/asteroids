# asteroids
Project completed as part of boot.dev's course. Slightly adjusted to work better(?)... maybe.

Suggested extensions from the course, which I may come back to include:
- A scoring system
- Multiple lives and respawning
- Asteroid explosion effects
- Acceleration
- Have objects wrap
- Different weapon types
- Alter hitboxes (i.e., give ship a triangular hitbox)
- Shields
- Speed power-up
- Bombs that can be dropped
